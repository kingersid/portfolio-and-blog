In this post, I am expressing my thoughts on Whatis design, and elaborating on the 10 principles of Good design by Dieter Ram ( Industrial Design : Braun Fame)

Design is a method of Problem solving. Design is so many things executed in so many ways. In the end it boils down to one thing. Design helps to solve a visual or physical problem.

A heuristic to know a good design from the not so good ones is that is should be undesigned. "The best designs are the ones which seem not designed at all"

Dieter Ram`s Ten principles of "Good design" 

1. Innovative

2. Makes a product useful

3. Aesthetic

4. Makes a product understable

5. Unobtrusive

6. Hones

7. Long lasting

8. Thorough

9. Environmentally friendly

10. As little design as possible.
